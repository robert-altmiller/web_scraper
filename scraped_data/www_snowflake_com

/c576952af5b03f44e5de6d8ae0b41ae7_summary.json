ACCEPTING ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MAY NOT USE ANY SNOWFLAKE OFFERINGS. YOU AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE LIKE ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY YOU.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">IF YOU ARE USING ANY SNOWFLAKE OFFERINGS AS AN EMPLOYEE, CONTRACTOR, OR AGENT OF A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY, THEN YOU MUST BE AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND SUCH ENTITY IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO.

This Agreement consists of the terms and conditions set forth below and any attachments, addenda or exhibits referenced in the Agreement, and any Order Forms that reference this Agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The \u201cEffective Date\u201d of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer\u2019s initial access to any Snowflake Offering (as defined below) through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order Form referencing this Agreement. This Agreement will govern Customer\u2019s initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer through an Order Form that reference this Agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Modifications to this Agreement: From time to time, Snowflake may modify this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified by Snowflake, changes become effective for Customer upon renewal of the then-current Subscription Term or upon the effective date of a new Order Form after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect. Snowflake will use reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the changes through communications via Customer\u2019s Account, email or other means. Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified Agreement before renewing a Subscription Term or upon the effective date of a new Order Form, and in any event continued use of any Snowflake Offering after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect will constitute Customer\u2019s acceptance of such updated version.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span style=\"color: #11567f;\">1. Use of Service</span></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>1.1. Service Provision and Access; Client Software</strong>. Snowflake will make the Service available to Customer for the Subscription Term solely for use by Customer and its Users in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Documentation, and the Order Form. Customer may permit its Contractors and Affiliates to serve as Users provided that any use of the Service by each such Contractor or Affiliate is solely for the benefit of Customer or such Affiliate. Customer shall be responsible for each User\u2019s compliance with this Agreement. To the extent use of the Service requires Customer to install Client Software, Snowflake grants to Customer and its Users a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license during the Subscription Term to use the object code form of the Client Software internally in connection with Customer\u2019s and its Affiliates\u2019 use of the Service, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Documentation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>1.2. Affiliates.</strong> Customer Affiliates may purchase Snowflake Offerings from Snowflake or an Authorized Snowflake Affiliate, as applicable, by executing an Order Form which is governed by the terms of this Agreement. This will establish a new and separate agreement between the Customer Affiliate and the Snowflake entity signing such Order Form. If the Customer Affiliate resides in a different country than Customer, then the Order Form may include modifications to terms applicable to the transaction(s) (including, but not limited to, tax terms and governing law).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>1.3. Compliance with Applicable Laws.</strong> Snowflake will provide the Snowflake Offerings in accordance with its obligations under laws and government regulations applicable to Snowflake\u2019s provision of such services to its customers generally, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy and data transfer, international communications, and the exportation of services, without regard to Customer\u2019s particular use of the services and subject to Customer\u2019s use of the services in accordance with this Agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>1.4. Sample Data; Third-Party Applications.</strong> Snowflake may make Sample Data available for Customer. Customer acknowledges that Sample Data is example data only, which may not be complete, current, or accurate. Customer will not (and will not permit any third party to) copy or export any Sample Data and agrees that Snowflake may delete or require Customer to cease using Sample Data at any time upon advance notice. Snowflake may also provide URL links or interconnectivity within the Service to facilitate Customer\u2019s use of Third-Party Applications, at Customer\u2019s sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any procurement or use of Third-Party Applications is solely between Customer and the applicable party, and Snowflake will have no liability for such Third-Party Applications under this Agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><b>1.5.

General Restrictions</strong>. Customer will not (and will not permit any third party to): (a) sell, rent, lease, license, distribute, provide access to, sublicense, or otherwise make available the Service (or any Deliverables, if applicable) to a third party (except as set forth in the Documentation for Service features expressly intended to enable Customer to provide its third parties with access to Customer Data, or as set forth in an SOW, as applicable) or in a service bureau or outsourcing offering; (b) use the Service to provide, or incorporate the Service into, any substantially similar cloud-based service for the benefit of a third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise seek to obtain the source code or non-public APIs to the Service, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance written notice to Snowflake); (d) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Service; (e) use the Service to engage in cryptocurrency mining without Snowflake\u2019s prior written consent; or (f) use any Snowflake Offerings in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>1.7.

Unless a BAA is in place, Snowflake will have no liability under this Agreement for HIPAA Data, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in HIPAA or any similar federal or state laws, rules or regulations. If Customer is permitted to process HIPAA Data in the Service, then Customer may process HIPAA Data in the Service only by providing it as Customer Data.

Confidentiality. </span></b>Each party (as \u201c<strong>Receiving Party</strong>\u201d) will use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to: (a) not use any Confidential Information of the other party (the \u201c<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>\u201d) for any purpose outside the scope of this Agreement; and (b) except as otherwise authorized by the Disclosing Party in writing, limit access to Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to those of its and its Affiliates\u2019 employees and contractors who need that access for purposes consistent with this Agreement and who are bound by obligations of confidentiality to the Receiving Party containing protections not materially less protective of the Confidential Information than those herein. If Receiving Party is required by law or court order to disclose Confidential Information, then Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide Disclosing Party with advance written notice and cooperate in any effort to obtain confidential treatment of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b style=\"font-size: 16px;\"><b><span style=\"color: #11567f;\">6. </span></b> <span style=\"color: #11567f;\">Fees and Payment; Taxes; Payment Disputes</span></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>6.1. Fees and Payment</strong>. All Fees and payment terms are as set forth in the applicable Order Form. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, all payment obligations are non-cancelable and Fees are non-refundable. If Customer issues a purchase order upon entering into an Order Form, then: (i) any such purchase order submitted by Customer is for its internal purposes only, and Snowflake rejects, and in the future is deemed to have rejected, any purchase order terms to the extent they add to or conflict in any way with this Agreement or the applicable Order Form and such additional or conflicting terms will have no effect; (ii) it shall be without limitation to Snowflake\u2019s right to collect Fees owing hereunder; (iii) it shall be for the total Fees owing under the applicable Order Form; and (iv) on request, Snowflake will reference the purchase order number on its invoices (solely for administrative convenience), so long as Customer provides the purchase order reasonably in advance of the invoice date. Snowflake will invoice Customer using the billing contact information set forth in the applicable Order Form. In the event Customer prefers to use any other billing platform for invoicing and payment hereunder, the parties will reasonably work together to facilitate the same, provided that such platform is: (i) able to accommodate the services payable hereunder; and (ii) operational without cost to Snowflake (i.e, use of such platform is either without out-of-pocket cost to Snowflake, including for any related set-up fees, or Customer promptly reimburses or otherwise credits Snowflake for any such additional costs or fees).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>6.2. Taxes.</strong> Fees do not include Taxes. Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, including without limitation all use or access of the Snowflake Offerings by its Users. If Snowflake has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Snowflake will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides Snowflake with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. Taxes will not be deducted from payments to Snowflake, except as required by applicable law, in which case Customer will increase the amount payable as necessary so that, after making all required deductions and withholdings, Snowflake receives and retains (free from any liability for Taxes) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Upon Snowflake\u2019s request, Customer will provide to Snowflake its proof of withholding tax remittance to the respective tax authority. Where applicable, Customer will provide its VAT/GST Registration Number(s) on the Order Form to confirm the business use of the purchased services.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>6.3. Payment Disputes.</strong> Snowflake will not exercise its rights under Section 7.2 (Termination for Cause) or Section 7.5(a) (Suspension of the Snowflake Offerings) with respect to non-payment by Customer if Customer is disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and is cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve such a dispute within thirty (30) days, each party shall have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any terms that would limit remedies on account of a dispute. For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>6.4. Reseller Orders.</strong> Customer may procure certain Snowflake Offerings through a Reseller pursuant to a Reseller Arrangement. Snowflake will only be obligated to provide the Snowflake Offerings to Customer in connection with a Reseller Arrangement if Snowflake and Reseller have executed an Order Form for such purchase. Customer acknowledges and agrees that, solely in connection with the purchase by Customer through a Reseller Arrangement: (a) Snowflake may share information with Reseller related to Customer\u2019s use and consumption of the Snowflake Offerings; (b) notwithstanding anything to contrary in this Agreement, references to \u201cCustomer\u201d in each of the defined terms \u201cFees\u201d and \u201cOrder Form\u201d in this Agreement shall be replaced with \u201cReseller,\u201d and all payments of fees, refunds and credits, if any, are payable by or to the Reseller; (c) this Agreement governs Customer\u2019s use of the Snowflake Offerings, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Reseller Arrangement; and (d) Reseller is not authorized to make any changes to this Agreement or otherwise authorized to make any warranties, representations, promises or commitments on behalf of Snowflake or in any way concerning the Snowflake Offerings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #11567f;\"><b>7. </b>Term and Termination</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>7.1. Term</strong>. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated in accordance with its terms. If there is no Order Form currently in effect, either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the other party. Each Order Form will terminate upon expiration of the applicable Subscription Term, unless expressly stated otherwise therein or in this Agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>7.2. Termination for Cause.</strong> Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay Fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice (without limiting Section 6.3 (Payment Disputes)); (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors\u2019 arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party and is not dismissed within 60 days. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise. For any termination of this Agreement by Customer for cause in accordance with Section 7.2(a), Customer shall be entitled to a refund of any prepaid unused Fees for the Service purchased hereunder.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>7.3. Effect of Termination; Customer Data Retrieval.</strong> Upon written notice to Snowflake, Customer will have up to thirty (30) calendar days from termination or expiration of this Agreement to access the Service solely to the extent necessary to retrieve Customer Data (\u201c<strong>Retrieval Right</strong>\u201d). If Customer exercises its Retrieval Right, this Agreement and the applicable Order Form shall continue in full force and effect for the duration of the Retrieval Right. Snowflake shall have no further obligation to make Customer Data available after the latter of (a) the effective date of termination of this Agreement, or (b) the Retrieval Right period, if applicable, and thereafter Snowflake shall promptly delete the Customer Data. After the Retrieval Right period, Customer will have no further access to Customer Data and shall cease use of and access to the Snowflake Offerings (including any related Snowflake Technology) and delete all copies of Client Software, Documentation, any associated passwords or access codes, and any other Snowflake Confidential Information in its possession. Notwithstanding any termination or anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Order Form, Customer shall pay for all of its use of the Snowflake Offerings.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>7.4. Survival.</strong> The following sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1.6 (General Restrictions), 4 (Intellectual Property), 5 (Confidentiality), 6.1 (Fees and Payment), 6.2 (Taxes), 7 (Term and Termination), 8.3 (Warranty Disclaimer), 11 (Indemnification), 12 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 13 (General Terms), and 14 (Definitions).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>7.5. Suspension of the Snowflake Offerings.</strong> In addition to any of its other rights or remedies (including, without limitation, any termination rights) set forth in this Agreement, Snowflake reserves the right to suspend provision of the Snowflake Offerings: (a) if any Fees are thirty (30) days or more overdue (and are not otherwise subject to Section 6.3 (Payment Disputes)); (b) if Snowflake deems such suspension necessary as a result of Customer\u2019s breach of Sections 1.6 (General Restrictions) or 2.2 (Use Obligations); (c) if Snowflake reasonably determines suspension is necessary to avoid material harm to Snowflake or its other customers, including if the Service is experiencing denial of service attacks, mail flooding, or other attacks or disruptions outside of Snowflake\u2019s control; or (d) as required by law or at the request of governmental entities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span style=\"color: #11567f;\">8.</span>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #11567f;\">Warranty</span></b></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>8.1. Service Warranty</strong>. Snowflake warrants that: (a) the Service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation; and (b) Technical Services and Deliverables will be provided in a professional and workmanlike manner and substantially in accordance with the specifications in the applicable SOW. If Snowflake is not able to correct any reported non-conformity with this warranty, either party may terminate the applicable Order Form or SOW (as applicable), and Customer, as its sole remedy, will be entitled to receive a refund of any prepaid unused Fees for the applicable Service or Technical Services purchased thereunder. This warranty will not apply if the error or non-conformance was caused by: (i) Customer\u2019s misuse of the Service or Deliverables; (ii) modifications to the Service or Deliverables by Customer or any third party; (iii) Third-Party Applications; or (iv) any services or hardware of Customer or any of its third parties used by Customer in connection with the Service or Deliverables. For Technical Services and Deliverables, this warranty will not apply unless Customer provides written notice of a claim within thirty (30) days after expiration of the applicable SOW.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>8.2. Mutual Warranty.</strong> Each party warrants that it has validly entered into this Agreement and has the legal power to do so.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>8.3. Warranty Disclaimer.</strong> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, EACH SNOWFLAKE OFFERING, THE CLIENT SOFTWARE AND SAMPLE DATA ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS,\u201d AND SNOWFLAKE MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Provision of Technical Services</strong>. Snowflake will perform the Technical Services for Customer as set forth in each applicable SOW, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>10.2. Assistance.</strong> Customer acknowledges that timely access to applicable Customer Materials, resources, personnel, equipment or facilities is necessary for the provision of Technical Services. Customer agrees to provide such access and to reasonably cooperate with Snowflake during a Technical Services project. Snowflake will have no liability for any delay or deficiency to the extent resulting from Customer\u2019s breach of its obligations under Section 10.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>10.3. Customer Materials.</strong> Customer hereby grants Snowflake a limited right to use any Customer Materials solely for the purpose of providing Technical Services to Customer. Customer will retain any of its rights (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Materials. Customer Materials comprising Confidential Information will be subject to Section 5 (Confidentiality). Customer warrants that Customer has and will have sufficient rights in the Customer Materials to grant the rights to Snowflake under this Agreement and that the Customer Materials will not violate any third-party rights.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>10.4. Access to Customer Data under an SOW.</strong> With respect to access to any Customer Data under an SOW, Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that both the duration and scope of access is strictly limited to the access required under the specific SOW. Customer agrees that it will not grant Snowflake access to Customer Data unless specifically required and noted in an SOW, and that Customer will grant any such access only during the term of the applicable Technical Services project. Unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Customer must ensure that: (a) any access to Customer Data that it grants is limited to read-only access in Customer\u2019s development environment for the Service (and Customer will not grant access to any other environment, such as its test, production or disaster recovery); and (b) Customer will not grant access to any Customer Data that is unencrypted or contains sensitive data, including without limitation, any personal data, credit card or other financial account information, or protected health information. To the extent access to Customer Data is granted, unless otherwise specified in an SOW, Customer will provide Snowflake with: (i) secure Customer workstations and networks for accessing Customer Data that are monitored, managed, configured, supported and maintained by Customer; and (ii) unique user ID/passwords to each Snowflake resource that requires access to Customer Data, and these credentials will be solely managed by Customer.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>10.5. License to Deliverables.</strong> The Technical Services Snowflake performs (e.g., providing guidance on configuring the Service) and the resulting Deliverables are generally applicable to Snowflake\u2019s business and are part of Snowflake Technology. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the restrictions in Section 1.6 (General Restrictions)), Snowflake hereby grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable worldwide license to use the Deliverables internally solely in connection with such Customer\u2019s use of the Service during the period in which such Customer has valid access to the Service. The parties may mutually agree to SOWs with additional terms and restrictions related to the use of Deliverables provided as part of that project, in which case those terms and restrictions will also apply for purposes of those Deliverables only.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>10.6. Change Orders; Other Terms.</strong> Customer may submit written requests to Snowflake to change the scope of Technical Services under an existing SOW. Snowflake will promptly notify Customer if it believes that the requested change requires an adjustment to the fees, schedule, assumptions or scope for the performance of the Technical Services. Neither party is bound by changes to an SOW unless the parties have entered into a Change Order with respect thereto. Snowflake may use subcontractors to deliver Technical Services but will remain responsible for their performance of those Technical Services under the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement. For clarity, Customer will be responsible for any consumption and other fees for the Service that are generated as part of the Technical Services.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span style=\"color: #11567f;\">11.\u00a0</span></b><span style=\"color: #11567f;\"><b>Indemnification</b></span></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>11.1. Indemnification by Snowflake</strong>. Snowflake will defend Customer against any claim by a third party alleging that the Service or any Deliverable, when used in accordance with this Agreement, infringes any intellectual property right of such third party and will indemnify and hold harmless Customer from and against any damages and costs awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by Snowflake (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) resulting from such claim. If Customer\u2019s use of the Service or Deliverable results (or in Snowflake\u2019s opinion is likely to result) in an infringement claim, Snowflake may either: (a) substitute functionally similar products or services; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Service or Deliverable; or if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c) terminate this Agreement, or the applicable Order Form or SOW, and refund to Customer any prepaid unused Fees for the applicable Service or Deliverable. The foregoing indemnification obligation of Snowflake will not apply to the extent the applicable claim is attributable to: (1) the modification of the Service or Deliverable by any party other than Snowflake or based on Customer\u2019s specifications or requirements; (2) the combination of the Service or Deliverable with products or processes not provided by Snowflake; (3) any use of the Service or Deliverables in non-conformity with this Agreement; or (4) any action arising as a result of Customer Data, or any deliverables or components not provided by Snowflake. This section sets forth Customer\u2019s sole remedy with respect to any claim of intellectual property infringement.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>11.2. Indemnification by Customer.</strong> Customer will defend Snowflake against any claim by a third party arising from or relating to any Customer Data, Customer Materials or any Customer-offered product or service used in connection with the Service and will indemnify and hold harmless Snowflake from and against any damages and costs awarded against Snowflake or agreed in settlement by Customer (including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) resulting from such claim.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\"><strong>11.3. Indemnification Procedures.</strong> In the event of a potential indemnity obligation under Section 11, the indemnified party will: (a) promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim, (b) allow the indemnifying party the right to control the investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim at the indemnifying party\u2019s sole cost and expense, and (c) upon request of the indemnifying party, provide all necessary cooperation at the indemnifying party\u2019s expense. Failure by the indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party of a claim under Section 11 shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations under Section 11. However, the indemnifying party shall not be liable for any litigation expenses the indemnified party incurred before such notice was given, or for any damages and/or costs resulting from any material prejudice caused by the delay or failure to provide notice to the indemnifying party in accordance with this section. The indemnifying party may not settle any claim that would bind the indemnified party to any obligation (other than payment covered by the indemnifying party or ceasing to use infringing materials) or require any admission of fault by the indemnified party, without the indemnified party\u2019s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Any indemnification obligation under Section 11 will not apply if the indemnified party settles or makes any admission with respect to a claim without the indemnifying party\u2019s prior written consent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b><span style=\"color: #11567f;\">12.
